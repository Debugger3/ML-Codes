I am a student of IIIT, Bangalore one of the premier institute in India . I have no source of income but I am deeply interested in Computer Science. I found Machine Learning very interesting and planning for a research career in it. I have no bank loan but have to pay the academic fees too. Also I am doing my masters after my UG. So already i have spent a lot on my acads. Please provide me this financial aid so that i can enrich my knowledge in Machine Learning



I am currently doing M.Tech and i found Machine Learning very very interesting. I wanted to this course as I am specialising in machine learning. I have found these lectures really good as they are practical and very clear in concepts.

I would make healthy discussion in the forums and also share things i learned. Given that I will not involve in any kind of cheating or plagiarism
