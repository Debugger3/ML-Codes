##More parameters means we need more data. It may happen that we cant do that and therefore we shpuld go for a model with lesser data. typical problem faced by deep neural networks

e.g: A model with many parameters require more data: observe that a full covariance matrix for an M-dimensional Gaussian will have M(M+1)/2 parameters to fit. With the number of parameters growing roughly as the square of the dimension, it may quickly become impossible to find a sufficient amount of data to make good inferences.
